## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

In this notebook , you will see the process of extracting text from image. You will use OpenCV to preprocess the image and use open-source tesseract library to extract text from pre-processed image.

- What is the background of your project?

In this notebok, we will be doing image processing using OpenCV.OpenCV is popular image processing library. It has wide variety of applications. Some of the popular applications are:
1. Pre-processing image
2. Detecting lines, circles, other shapes etc.
3. Edge detection
4. Image segmentation
5. Object Tracking

- Business Problem Statement:

In this notebook we are trying to do Optical Character Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

We have got the dataset from Upgrad.
